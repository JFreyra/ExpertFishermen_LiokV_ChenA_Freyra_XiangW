## Potato Productivity: About
Potato Productivity is a productivity tool that utilizes a user database and the Spotify API to help the user stay productive. The main feature of the site is the Pomodoro timer, which times the user while they work and notifies them when they should take a quick break to keep their mind fresh and prevent burning out. There will be a dynamic task list on the side that will allow the user to add tasks as they come up and delete them as they complete them. The site will also implement the Spotify API and generate either a random work playlist or a playlist based on the userâ€™s preferences.

## How to use
1) When you're ready to start working, run app.py

2) Enter localhost:5000 in the search bar

3) The timer will automatically start counting down from 25 minutes. Once the 25 minute work period is over, you will be notified and will begin a 4 minute rest period. This cycle continues 3 times before prompting you to start from the top again.

4) You can use the to-do list widget to keep track of tasks at hand. Drag & drop based on priority, add/remove items as needed.

5) You can use the music widget to listen to some tunes while working. Simply enter a song title, artist, or both to receive results (Spotify is required to listen to these songs).
